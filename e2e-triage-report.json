      "reasoning": "The failure occurs because the test is waiting for a dropdown button (<button.MuiButtonBase-root...css-rr1wpw>) to be visible, but it is not visible at the time of assertion. The Cypress error message and the screenshot both show that the button is not visible, and the screenshot reveals that a UI overlay or modal (with the text 'Adding an image component') is covering the bottom of the page. In the logs, Cypress specifically states: 'This element <button...> is not visible because it has CSS property: position: fixed and it's being covered by another element: <div class=\"css-gya850 e2rityt0\">...'. This means the application UI is in a state where the dropdown button is not interactable due to an overlay or modal, which is an application behavior issue, not a test flakiness or selector problem. The test is correctly waiting for the button to be visible, but the application is preventing it due to a UI overlay. This is further supported by the fact that the test code and selector are correct, and the button should be visible at this step if the UI flow was correct. Therefore, the root cause is a product/UI bug where overlays are not being dismissed or are blocking essential controls.",

The Cypress error message and screenshot show that the expected element is not visible because it is covered by another element: '<div class=\"css-19ajheb e1gwl51l0\">'. In the screenshot, the application UI is in a 'Congrats! You've made it to the end of this skill!' state, with the 'Finish skill' button visible. This is an end-of-flow modal or overlay that covers the main content, including the auto-save indicator. This overlay is a normal part of the app's UX when the skill is completed, and the test is trying to assert visibility of an element that is intentionally hidden or covered at this point. The logs and screenshot do not show any application errors, crashes, or API failures. The test code is not synchronizing correctly with the UI state transitions and is making assertions at a time when the element cannot be visible due to the overlay. This is a classic test timing/synchronization issue, not a product bug.",
